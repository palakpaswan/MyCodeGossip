<h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>  
<br>
<br>
 <b class="b">What is Javascript?</b>
<p>
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
<br>
The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
<br>
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
<br>
In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called <b>Java</b>. 
</p> 
<div style="border:1px solid black;padding:15px">
<b class="b">Why is it called JavaScript?</b>
<p>
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
<br>
But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called <b>ECMAScript</b>, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<b class="b">What makes JavaScript unique?</b>
<p>
There are at least three great things about JavaScript :
</p>
<div style="border:1px solid black;padding:10px">
<ul  style="font-family:Serif;word-spacing:5px;font-size:20px;">
<li style="color:#384370;font-weight:bold;font-size:22px">Full integration with HTML/CSS.<br><br></li>
<li style="color:#384370;font-weight:bold;font-size:22px">Simple things are done simply.<br><br></li>
<li style="color:#384370;font-weight:bold;font-size:22px">Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<td>Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically.</td>
<td>Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Variable data types are not declared (dynamic typing, loosely typed).</td>
<td>Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed).</td>
